# HID-gamepad
This is my attemt to make a HID gamepad using an Arduino Mega R3 (32u2 and 2560). 

This repository (and following code) is a work in progress. I am working on this project, as something for me to do in the holidays. Expect documentation, in form of a Wiki, comming up after initial testing of the code. 


### Steps to be done:

- [X] Define data-structure of internal communication
- [ ] Write serial parser for the 32u2
- [X] Write a routine to collect data from hardware

### Changelog ([Full log](https://github.com/iLyngklip/HID-gamepad/commits/master))

#### 0.0.9 - The "Hello world!" update
* Sub-systems is ready for whole-system testing


#### 0.0.8

### Currently using:
