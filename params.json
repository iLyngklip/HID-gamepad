I am working on this project, as something for me to do in the holidays. Expect documentation, in form of a Wiki, comming up after initial testing of the code. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to be done:\r\n\r\n- [X] Define data-structure of internal communication\r\n- [ ] Write serial parser for the 32u2\r\n- [ ] Write a routine to collect data from hardware\r\n\r\n\r\n### Currently using:\r\n\r\n* [HoodLoader2](https://github.com/NicoHood/HoodLoader2)\r\n* [HID-project](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFeel free to contact me, should you feel the need!\r\n",
